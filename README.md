# Payments PWA

## Description


The inspiration for this thesis project came from my travels through several countries in Asia, where I observed that payment apps were widely used but inaccessible to foreign users due to the need for a local bank account for onramping. To address this challenge, I decided to create a payment app that is open and permissionless, built on blockchain technology and uses progressive web app technology. The aim of this app is to provide a seamless payment experience to users. The app uses a layer 2 blockchain to create an app that is secure, permissionless, fast, and accessible to all users. 

The app provides an easy-to-use interface that allows users to store, transfer, and receive payments via a blockchain. In addition, it implements account abstraction to create a smart contract account for users, enhancing the user experience when interacting with the blockchain.

## Why blockchain
Blockchain technology was chosen to build the app on top, not just for its open source and community-driven nature but also for its developer-friendly features. This technology empowers developers by providing them with auditable and transparent tools, reliable and self-custodial systems, and globally accessible platforms, making them an integral part of the blockchain ecosystem. Recent advancements in Layer 2 blockchains have further boosted scalability and transaction throughput, enhancing their UX.

## Why Base
Base was chosen as it falls into the greater vision outlined the Optimism Foundation, the Superchain.
